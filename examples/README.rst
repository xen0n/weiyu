Usage examples
==============

Here you can find example(s) on how to make use of the weiyu framework.
Most of them are meant for use inside a virtualenv. You should first copy
the directory out of weiyu's repository if you decide to try out the
example, as during experiment I found out that sometimes Python won't be
able to locate ``weiyu`` if the library is put on the Python path by use of
``.pth`` files.
